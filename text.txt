---About Me---
Hi, my name is Rishi. I am a Software Engineer at Palantir. I graduated from 
Cornell University in 2021 with an MEng in Computer Science and a BS in Applied 
Economics and Management. I like building software products and investing. In 
my free time I like to kick it with friends and spend time with family, either 
playing sports, eating good food, or exploring the outdoors.
